Tactical RP - Base

Tactical RP is a remix of assets and mechanics from *Tactical Intervention,* and ill-fated Source shooter that notably featured animations by Minh "Gooseman" Le, the creator of Counter-Strike.
TacRP features remade mechanics from TI such as quick-throw grenades, blindfire and melee bashing, as well as its own mechanics such as free aim and sight peeking.
