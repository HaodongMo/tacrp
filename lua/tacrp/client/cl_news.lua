<p>Thank you for using Tactical RP, and welcome to our new newsletter!<br>
<span style="font-size:80%;"><i>If you forgot you had TacRP installed, we're sorry for distrubing your gmod session, please don't unsubscribe</i></span></p>

<p>You can now catch up with updates, dev blogs, and more, all from the comfort of your own video game! A few posts (like this one) are embedded within the addon and will always be available, while others will be fetched remotely so you can get the hottest news without updating the addon.</p>

<p>Major updates and releases will be displayed on startup, while minor posts will bring up a reminder in the chat box. If you want to be only notified for major updates, toggle the checkbox above.</p>

<p>Despite the cold reception TacRP got at launch, some of you stuck with us (or at least tolerated its presence in the weapons tab), and we cannot thank you enough for your support. That's why we here at <b>Garry's Mod Tactical Realism Industriesâ„¢</b><i style="font-size:50%;">(trademark pending)</i> are cooking up more good stuff for you to enjoy, including an <i>expansion pack full of new weapons</i>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we hope you enjoy Tactical RP, and remember:<br>
<i>No matter what Arctic might say, the RP in TacRP stands for Remix Pack, not Role Play!</i>
<br><span style="font-size:50%;opacity:0.25;">It is seriously kind of stupid to put roleplay in your weapon pack name. Is there even a DarkRP server out there that uses these guns? Don't they all just use M9K? Why do we even make new weapon packs if a decade-old weapon base with no c_hands is enough for them? Is humanity truly doomed? sussy imposter amogus??? skull emoji</span></p>

<p>It's here!<br></p>

<p>Alongside the release of thirty-one new weapons in the Interops pack, a long list of changes have also dropped. They've been sneakily updated (sorry) but I've finally bothered to write the patch notes for them now.</p>

<p>Without being too verbose, here is a shortlist of all the changes up until this point.</p>

<h3>Armor Penetration</h3>
<p>Combat can get really awkward with HL2 armor absorbing 80% of all damage. Now, TacRP braves the unknown to become the second addon to ever challenge this status quo! (The first being, of course, my own Danger Zone Entities. #humblebrag)<br>
Every weapon has an Armor Piercing and Armor Shredding value. The former dictates how much damage is blocked by armor and the latter determines how much damage armor takes.
All weapons have naturally been balanced to use these numbers, so you can expect a tactical experience even with armor.</p>
<p>Of course, TacRP is fully compatible with Danger Zone Entities' armor, and will use the weapons' AP value for them.</p>

<h3>TTT Support</h3>
<p>It's a match made in heaven! TacRP will now natively support TTT, and using it is as easy as installing and opening the game. In addition to compatibility, a new set of stats have been made for the mode in particular so that the weapons' balance is similar to vanilla TTT.<br>
Several guns are added as buyable equipment, like the launchers, anti-materiel snipers, and the riot shield.<br>
There's also two buyable equipment, an attachment bench (if you restrict customization), and an ammo box.</p>

<h3>Rebalance... Again</h3>
<p>I just can't help it. The default "Tactical" balance mode has been rewritten to be less slow (considering reduced movement speed in most roleplay modes), and higher-tiered weapons are less overpowered, albeit still stronger on average.<br>
With the addition of new weapons to round out the set, some category changes have also been made.</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>You can do so many things with these guns it's hard to keep track. Now, you don't have to!<br>
Hints will show up reminding you what contextually relevant buttons you can press. It'll also nag you to bind your grenade input.</p>

<h3>Stats Menu Rework</h3>
<p>The stats menu finally has a scroll bar to scroll through all those numbers. They also now show the change in difference as a percentage.</p>

<h3>Held Grenades</h3>
<p>Relevant to TTT, you can now pull out grenades as weapons. Unfortunately I was not able to get custom viewmodels for them, so bear with the CSS placeholders for a bit.<br>
Also, if you have Danger Zone Entities, you can quickthrow and switch to Bump Mines.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyways, I hope all of you have as much fun with the Interops weapons as speedonerd and I had making them. It's a pleasure seeing these old models come to life again.<br>
Be sure to check out the Interops workshop page as well as Danger Zone Entities.</p>

<p>No update survives first contact. As is tradition, things immediately break when I push updates. Even if the version number is my lucky number.</p>
<p>In addition to some fixes, I've also added a few small but cool things, like the ability to pick up DNA from dropped magazines in TTT, and gas effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Added:</b> Overlay, motion blur and color modification when affected by gas directly (but not lingering damage).
<li><b>Added:</b> (TTT) Dropped magazines (including grenade spoons) contain DNA of the dropper and no longer fade.
<li><b>Added:</b> (TTT) Customization Bench allows you to freely customize (equivalent to free atts).
<li><b>Added:</b> (TTT) Picking up a grenade will make the player select it as a quicknade if the current selection isn't valid.
<li><b>Balance:</b> Sticky sounds (Breaching Charges, C4) and quickthrow sounds are less loud.
<li><b>Balance:</b> (TTT) Breaching Charges have a bigger blast radius, slightly lower damage and much quieter beeps.
<li><b>Balance:</b> Gas grenades no longer do damage when exploding.
<li><b>Balance:</b> Flashbang blast and effect radius now 728 (previously 512 and 1024).
<li><b>Changed:</b> (TTT) Random attachments will try to avoid duplicates and respect InvAtt.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Various issues with the Medkit.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Bodygroup related errors.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Quicknade and grenade weapons do not respect ttt_no_nade_throw_during_prep.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Gas grenade doesn't cause sway and coughing when below health threshold.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Attachments do not sync properly if weapon is out of PVS initially (such as spawning in TTT).

<p>I'm sure I've missed some more, so send any issues or suggestions my way!</p>

<p>A humble update. Aside from a lot of internal changes, some systems have been reworked and a new ammo attachment for pistols is added.</p>

<h3>Jamming Rework</h3>
<p>Arctic added jamming for fun and neither of us really knew what to do with it. We didn't want to just slap it on all guns just because, but there also seemed to not be any good reason to put it anywhere.
In lieu of a better idea, I've elected to give the surplus attachments some dubious upside that at the very least may be interesting.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the chance to jam is now based on ammo type, with attachments adding a "Jam Factor" instead of modifying percentage chances directly. This should help prevent pistols, shotguns and snipers from jamming too infrequently compared to automatic high fire rate guns.</p>


<h3>Free Aim Rework</h3>
<p>Free Aim was one of those features that nobody liked - admittedly, not even myself. But I couldn't not give it another chance.</p>
<ul>
<li>All weapons now have their own Free Aim Angle, typically between 2-9 degrees. Generally speaking, pistols, SMGs and stockless weapons have little free aim.
<li>Overall free aim value is much lower. Most rifles will have 4-5 degrees, and only cumbersome weapons like snipers and machine guns will have high values.
<li>Free aim point of aim moves across the screen slower.
</ul>

<h3>Mr. Worldwide</h3>
<p>Ported over the localization system used in ARC9. As of now, there are no other languages, so if you are interested in contributing your language, please contact me or make a pull request!<br>
An additional benefit is that a lot of the attachments now use consistent wording due to switching to phrases.</p>

<h3>Changelist</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Free Aim rework.
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Jamming rework.
<li><b>Added:</b> Surplus Ammo and Surplus Bolt gained unique behavior. They still jam though.
<li><b>Added:</b> Steel Core Rounds for pistols, basically the oppposite of Hollowpoints.
<li><b>Added:</b> Localization system. Currently only Chinese Simplified is available.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> (Arcade) Most pistols are no longer lethal on headshot without Hollowpoints/Skullsplitter.

<p>The customization menu is getting a little cramped with all the tactical customization going on. The new UI should be way more concise, hiding all the options behind a click but still allowing you to see all your current choices at a glance.</p>

<p>If you're not a fan, the legacy menu option can be toggled back with the checkbox in the bottom left.</p>

<p>Besides that, there's also 2 more suppressor options to make the Muzzle slot a little less lonely. Also, they're suppressors and not silencers now.</p>

<h3>Changelist</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Customization menu rework.
<li><b>Added:</b> Support for DynaMetR's Customizable HL2 HUD. Secondary ammo will display the type and amount of the currently selected quicknade, and ammo pickup will also display correctly.
<li><b>Added:</b> Compact Suppressor. Reduces spread, lower penalty compared to the Silencer (now Tactical Suppressor).
<li><b>Added:</b> Weighted Suppressor. Increases range and reduces recoil, but worsens ADS and sprint time.
<li><b>Added:</b> Akimbo variants for some attachments.
<li><b>Added:</b> Icons for PS90 and HK94 (thanks speedonerd).
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Tactical Suppressor also reduces recoil spread penalty (5%).
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Akimbo trigger has weaker RPM penalty (10%).
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Reduced recoil spread on several assault rifles.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Reduced recoil on the RPG-7 drastically.
<li><b>Changed:</b> Adjusted shooting volume on some weapons for consistency. Pistol caliber weapons have ~110dB, carbines ~120dB, and the rest are ~130dB.
<li><b>Changed:</b> Stat differences are now rounded to the whole percent (due to rounding errors in the values, the extra precision is meaningless).
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Adjusted suppressor positions on some guns.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Akimbo pistols use last shot animation correctly.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Pre-emptively fix an upcoming issue in the June 2023 update related to loading server files in Singleplayer.

<p>This update introduces changes to how recoil and spread works. Before, most "Recoil" stats were actually affecting spread, and Recoil Kick was the only actual recoil stat. These stats are now renamed to Bloom, and their behavior has changed as well.</p>

<p>Under the new system, instead of your gun magically becoming less accurate as you shoot, the recoil becomes stronger instead. If you wish to revert to old behavior, untick "Bloom Modifies Recoil" in the Mechanics setting page.</p>

<p>Recoil Stability is a new stat that makes recoil go more straight up. Previously, recoil could go anywhere within a 180 degree half circle - this is equivalent to 0% stability now. Certain guns, especially high recoil rifles, have increased stability to make their recoil manageable.</p>

<p>The intent of the overall change is to improve the viability of high recoil weapons and to make medium to long range combat more viable on non-sniper rifles.</p>

<h3>Changelist</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Alternate Recoil Mode.
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Recoil Stability stat.
<li><b>Added:</b> All weapons gain a 0.01 moving spread penalty.
<li><b>Added:</b> You can now bind +tacrp_melee to any button to quick melee. E+LMB will still work.
<li><b>Added:</b> ConVar to allow firing while sprinting, in case you're a boomer shooter enthuasist.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Fold Stock and Adjust Stock reduce ADS and sprint time by 0.08/0.04 seconds instead of a percentage, and recoil is reduced.
<li><b>Changed:</b> Some "Recoil" stats are now named Bloom. Their functionality remains identical.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Certain lower resolutions unable to display attachments properly.

<p>With so many updates on the list, I'm starting to run out of quirky hooks to put in front of patch notes. Ah well, nobody reads this anyways.</p>

<h3>A Twenty-Three Millimeter Shotgun</h3>
<p>The old model was the first re-rigged weapon for TacRP and had quite a few flaws. It's been replaced with the model from FA:S2, complete with actual sounds, visible shells during reloading and cycling, and a slight buff.</p>

<p>In addition, the Zvezda flash shell has a new variant which only loads the top shell as a flashbang, for more practical applications.</p>

<h3>Stat Menu Expansion</h3>
<p>Number lovers rejoice, for there's been a heap of changes to the stat menu. The whole thing has been reorganized and spacers are added to group stats into (mostly) sensible categories. Furthermore, a couple of missing stats have now been added.</p>

<h3>Smooth like Tactical Butter</h3>
<p>Previously, leaving sprint was an awkward action that prevented you from doing what you want: aiming down sights. Not anymore! You can start aiming as soon as you let go of sprint; however, this will be slower than normal and you still cannot fire for the Sprint to Fire duration.</p>

<p>Shotguns can now also immediately cancel reloading to fire, making them more useful in a pinch.</p>

<h3>Grenade View Models</h3>
<p>Speedonerd very kindly rigged the grenades to CSS viewmodels so you don't have to pretend you're using our grenades anymore.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Changelist</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Major Change:</b> Stat menu expansion.
<li><b>Major Change:</b> New KS-23 Model and sounds (from FA:S 2). New KS-23 attachment: Top-loaded Zvezda shells.
<li><b>Added:</b> Muzzle Light feature: brief flash of projected light when firing, like L4D2. Only visible on self, can be disabled.
<li><b>Added:</b> You can now aim the weapon while exiting sprint state, albeit at a slower speed.
<li><b>Added:</b> Shotgun reloading can be instantly cancelled (configurable, default on).
<li><b>Added:</b> Akimbo pistols now use the correct worldmodel attachments and drop magazines from both hands.
<li><b>Added:</b> Better effects system to allow for double ejects and muzzles on certain expansion guns.
<li><b>Added:</b> Client config "Aiming Stops Sprinting" (default on).
<li><b>Added:</b> "Lower Weapon While Airborne" config (default off), because bhopping is not tactical.
<li><b>Added:</b> You can now reset all client configs in the menu with a button.
<li><b>Added:</b> Grenade viewmodels rigged to CS:S animations by speedonerd.
<li><b>Added:</b> Holding overhand throw for pulled out grenades increases throw velocity by up to 50% over 0.25s.
<li><b>Added:</b> RPM Burst and Semi multipliers.
<li><b>Added:</b> Flashbangs will now stun human type NPCs.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Triggers now affect Recoil Stability.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Burst trigger has increased RPM for burst fire mode only.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Scope glint is slightly more visible and starts being visible closer.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Frag grenades, C4s and Breach Charges do more damage.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Buffed AMD-65, FB Beryl 96, HK94 and PS90.
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Mag Extender slows reload by 3-5% (weapon type dependent).
<li><b>Rebalance:</b> Adjusted burst fire weapons to accomdate for RPM Burst multipliers.
<li><b>Changed:</b> When "Allow Reload While Sprinting" is disabled, sprinting cancels reload (unless ammo is already replenished).
<li><b>Changed:</b> Shuffled around some options in Mechanics menu.
<li><b>Changed:</b> Adjusted thermite effects and removed initial explosion. Thermite now ignites non-players.
<li><b>Changed:</b> Adjusted some rating rules.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Error when trying to pick up weapon in DarkRP caused by incorrect hook usage.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Should fix situation where removed smokes still block targetid.
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Firing buffer does not trigger when weapon is locked in animation (shotgun reload finishing).
<li><b>Fixed:</b> Weapon withs >100% AP deal more damage than normal and restores armor.

<p>What is Tactical may never die. Is that how the saying goes?
<br>Here's an update that's been cooking for a while. We've got a bit of everything: cool new features that enhance gameplay, visual reworks to some old models, performance update, it's all here.</p>

<h2>Shots 1-5: Clearly Missed</h2>
<p>Not enough skill issue in your Garry's Mod weapon addon? Now, instead of complaining about random recoil spread, you're gonna have to complain about something else, cause it's no longer random.</p>

<p>Similar to CS:GO (I guess it's now CS2)'s implementation, weapon recoil will follow a consistent pattern, typically going upwards until reaching a "suppression threshold", after which recoil becomes mostly horizontal.</p>

<p>Best used with "Bloom Modifies Recoil". Guns that have low RPM (<100), are burst fire, or shoot entities do not use patterns.</p>

<h2>I'll take "Useless Firearm Knowledge" for 500, Alex</h2>
<p>Want to know more about all the guns we have? No? Damn, cause we wasted a lot of hours putting in trivia and credits for</p>

<p><i>Every. Single. Gun.</i> There's like over a hundred. Yeah.</p>

<p>There's also now a credits page, so you know who to thank for the pretty models in all of our packs!</p>

<p>For additional realism, some guns have their names changed. The exception is the TGS-12, which we're almost certain Gooseman made up and is just a Bekas decked with aftermarket parts.</p>

<h2>Pod means legs, Bi means two</h2>
<p>The previous iteration of bipod was like pretending to use a bipod. It was not very fun. So I went ahead and implemented a proper bipod system.</p>

<p>Now, you can deploy bipod on any surface by aiming down sights when the prompt shows up. While deployed, you can enjoy significantly reduced bloom gain and recoil kick, zero sway and free aim, and reduced hip spread (based on peeking bonus).</p>

<p>AS50, MG4, Hecate and SA58 come with a bipod in the base pack. They are now innate and no longer take up your Accessory slot (the Bipod attachment is deprecated). Plus, the bipod will unfold while deployed and fold up when it's not. Neat!</p>

<h2>Steady, Steady...</h2>
<p>Sway is kinda annoying when you want to snipe. Now, you can hold your breath to stop swaying for a little bit, like most modern games.</p>

<p>The amount of breath meter drained is dependent on Scoped Sway. Iron sights and low magnification optics are easier to hold still with. Careful not to hold too long, as running low or out will increase sway significantly!</p>

<h2>Facelifts</h2>
<p>The Glock 17 model has been swapped out for the cooler one by Twinke Masta.
<br>The Hecate II now has its original scope and bipod models, and the animations have been improved a little.</p>

        Contents = [[<body style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';color:white;font-size:125%;">
<p>This is speedonerd speaking! I'm one of the other people working on this mess, mainly in the asset department (models, sounds, animations).
<p>We've got quite the update here, one that brought on more things than we initially anticipated adding, including a bunch of new configuration options and a total melee system rework.

<h2>They have guns...lots of guns...</h2>
<p>NPC support now has a new dropdown menu, sorted by weapon type so you can easily find whatever weapon you're looking for. Within each category you can specify a certain weapon or have NPCs pick a random weapon from each quality tier.
<p>And for those who enjoy chaos, we've included an option for NPCs to spawn with <i>any</i> weapon randomly. Enjoy a random rebel with no sense of self-preservation facerocketing you!

<h2>drop me avp plz</h2>
<p>There's now a dedicated button in the customization menu to drop your current weapon, with dropped weapons able to be picked up with your 'use' key. 
<p>This synergizes with weapon slot restrictions, allowing you to swap weapons with any gun you find lying around with the press of a button.

<h2>It's like wading through molasses.</h2>
<p>In case you don't like how a certain balancing scheme punishes movement, there are now convars for each of the movement penalties that let you turn them off individually. 
<p>They can all be found under Movement in the Mechanics tab.

<h2>What happened to my freakin' car?!</h2>
<p>Fighting against vehicles with TacRP will now be a lot more interesting thanks to some hackery and workarounds to make infantry-to-vehicle combat functional.
<p>TacRP now works with LVS' armor penetration system, allowing gunfire, launched grenades and rockets to pierce vehicle armor. 
<p>Combine Hunter Choppers, infamous for their hardcoded immunity to everything but airboat gun damage, can now take damage from direct hits with rockets.

<h2>Now this...is a knife.</h2>
<p>TacRP's melee system has been very superficial for a while now with little statistical difference between weapons (which is especially prominent if you have Brute Force installed) and were more goofy than they were actually viable. 
<p>As such, we've remade the melee system with a host of new features, including actual weapon stats and a new attachment slot: Boost, which acts as a perk slot with various passive benefits from simple stat boosts to unique effects like regaining health. 
<p>The base pack's knives and every weapon from Brute Force have been updated to use this new system.

<h2>You kids today don't know how to circlestrafe!</h2>
<p>Do you yearn for the good old days, when shooters were fun because they didn't have depth or good game balance? I did for a brief period, and it compelled me to quickly integrate a new balance mode that removed ironsights and tightened up weapon spread. 
<p>It didn't really pan out how I had hopedâ€”TacRP is built around so many modern mechanics and systems that it's hard to make it "old school" without stripping away nearly all of them. 
<p>Regardless, what I ended up with before abandoning it is still accessible via the console for preservation's sake, if you're interested.
